## Before the Sun Rises

My alarm goes off at 4:30 AM every Saturday morning. While most of Turlock is still sleeping, I'm in the kitchen, carefully packing loaves into my wicker baskets, double-checking my inventory, and loading up the car with the week's bakes.

There's something magical about these dark, quiet hours. The bread is still warm from the oven. The air smells like sourdough and coffee. And there's this feeling of anticipation—knowing that in a few hours, I'll be connecting with our community over something I made with my own hands.

## The Market Comes Alive

By 6:00 AM, I'm at the market setting up my booth. Other vendors are arriving too—the produce farmers with their fresh greens, the honey lady with her golden jars, the olive oil maker from Modesto. We exchange sleepy hellos and help each other set up. There's a beautiful camaraderie among market vendors—we're all early risers who believe in local food and community.

The first customers usually arrive around 7:30 AM. They're the regulars, the ones who know to come early for the best selection. There's Maria, who buys a country loaf every single week. Tom and Sarah, who always ask about new seasonal specials. The Peterson family with their three kids, who let them each pick out a scone.

## More Than Transactions

What I didn't expect when I started Flourish was how much the farmer's market would become about relationships, not just sales. I know my customers' names. I know who's gluten-free (and always looking for the one scone I make with alternative flour). I know who prefers darker crusts and who likes them golden.

People linger at my booth. They ask about my starter, share their own baking disasters, tell me about the dinner party where my bread was the star. Some Saturdays, I feel more like a therapist than a baker—which is to say, I feel honored that bread creates these moments of connection.

## The Seasonal Rhythm

Every season brings its own energy to the market. In spring, everyone's excited about fresh strawberries—so I make my strawberry scones. Summer means early morning heat and customers in shorts and sandals, buying bread for beach picnics. Fall brings pumpkin-everything requests. And winter? Cold mornings, lots of hot coffee, and customers wanting hearty, crusty loaves for soups and stews.

I've learned to read the seasons through what people buy. It's taught me to bake with intention, to think about how bread fits into the rhythm of life in our Central Valley community.

## Why I Keep Showing Up

Running a bakery from home is hard work. The hours are long. The profit margins are slim. Some weeks, I wonder if it's sustainable.

But then Saturday comes. I see the joy on a kid's face when they bite into a chocolate scone. I watch couples shopping together, planning their week's meals around which loaf to buy. I hear "This bread changed my life" (yes, someone actually said that). And I remember why I do this.

The farmer's market isn't just where I sell bread—it's where Flourish comes alive. It's where I'm reminded that food is about more than nourishment. It's about community, connection, and the simple pleasure of breaking bread together.
