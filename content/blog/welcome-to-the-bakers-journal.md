## A New Chapter

Welcome to The Baker's Journal! I'm Annie, and I'm thrilled to share stories from my kitchen in Turlock, California. This space is my digital hearth—a place to gather, share, and celebrate the quiet magic of sourdough baking.

For years, I've been waking up before dawn to tend my starter, shape loaves, and pack up for the farmer's market. Each Saturday morning, I meet the incredible people of our community, exchange stories over fresh-baked bread, and witness the simple joy that comes from sharing food made with care.

## Why Start a Journal?

Baking has taught me so much about patience, about trusting the process, and about the beauty of slow fermentation. I wanted a place to share not just recipes, but the philosophy behind them—the why, not just the how.

You'll find stories about:
- **The daily rhythms** of a small bakery
- **Seasonal ingredients** and how they inspire new loaves
- **Sourdough techniques** I've learned along the way
- **Behind-the-scenes glimpses** of farmer's market mornings
- **The community** that makes Flourish what it is

## What to Expect

This isn't a place for perfection. You'll see flour-dusted counters, slightly misshapen loaves, and the honest reality of running a micro-bakery from home. My hope is that these stories inspire you to slow down, to get your hands dirty, and to discover your own relationship with bread.

Whether you're a seasoned baker or just curious about sourdough, I'm glad you're here. Pull up a chair, pour yourself some coffee, and let's talk bread.
