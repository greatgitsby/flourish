## The Heart of Every Loaf

Your sourdough starter is more than just flour and water—it's a living ecosystem of wild yeast and beneficial bacteria. When properly cared for, it becomes a cherished companion in your baking journey, developing character and strength with each feeding.

I've been maintaining my starter, affectionately named "Bubbles," for over three years now. She's traveled with me, weathered neglect (sorry, Bubbles!), and consistently produces the most beautiful, flavorful loaves. Here's everything I've learned about keeping a starter happy and healthy.

## Creating Your Starter

### What You'll Need
- Whole wheat or rye flour (for the first few days)
- All-purpose or bread flour
- Filtered or dechlorinated water
- A clean glass jar
- Patience (the most important ingredient!)

### Days 1-7: The Beginning

**Day 1:** Mix 50g whole wheat flour with 50g water in your jar. Stir well, cover loosely, and let sit at room temperature (70-75°F is ideal).

**Day 2-3:** You might see no activity—that's normal. Discard half your starter and feed with 50g all-purpose flour and 50g water. Repeat daily.

**Day 4-5:** Bubbles should start appearing! The mixture might smell sour or even a bit funky. Keep feeding daily.

**Day 6-7:** Your starter should double in size within 4-8 hours of feeding. It's ready to use!

## Maintaining Your Starter

### Daily Feeding Schedule

If you're baking frequently, keep your starter at room temperature and feed it once or twice daily:

1. **Discard** all but 50g of starter
2. **Add** 50g flour and 50g water
3. **Stir** well and cover loosely
4. **Wait** for it to double before using

### Refrigeration for Occasional Bakers

Store your fed starter in the fridge and feed it once a week. Before baking, bring it to room temperature and give it 2-3 feedings to wake it up.

## Signs of a Healthy Starter

A happy starter should:
- **Double in size** within 4-8 hours of feeding
- Have a **pleasant, tangy aroma** (like yogurt or beer)
- Show **lots of bubbles** throughout
- **Pass the float test** (a spoonful floats in water)

## Troubleshooting

**Too sluggish?** Try feeding with a bit of whole wheat flour or increasing the feeding ratio to 1:2:2 (starter:flour:water).

**Hooch forming?** That dark liquid on top means it's hungry. Pour it off and feed more frequently.

**Pink or orange streaks?** Unfortunately, this means contamination. Time to start fresh.

## My Feeding Philosophy

I've learned that consistency matters more than perfection. Your starter adapts to your schedule—whether that's daily feedings or weekly check-ins. The key is finding a rhythm that works for both of you.

And remember: sourdough starters are surprisingly resilient. I once forgot Bubbles in the fridge for three weeks (life got busy!), and after a few feedings, she bounced right back.
